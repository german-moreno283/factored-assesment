# Front-end
### To run this code through docker, it is necessary to build it with this command: `"docker build --pull --rm -f "back/Dockerfile" -t factoredassesment-back:1.0 "back"`
### The next command is for running the container, with this command: `docker run -d -p {PORT}:80 --name docker-factored-back factoredassesment-back:1.0;` Where {PORT} is the port where the application shall run. Usually the 8000 but you can change it if you need to.
