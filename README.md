# Factored Internship assesment
## Germ√°n Moreno
### Welcome, in this repo you will find both the frontend and backend for the assesment. Each one in a different folder. Inside each folder there is a README file with the instructions to run the docker containers for the respective servers.

### The backend is built with fastAPI for the requests and SQLAlchemy for the database. 

### The frontend is built using purely reactJS, the requests to the database are made through async functions and fetch.

### In order for everything to work correctly, please run first the backend service and then the frontend.

### All the container build and runs must be done in the parent folder.
